CQRS.Mediatr.Lite is a light-weight library to implement the CQRS pattern in .NET solutions. The motivation for this library comes from the popular [Mediatr library](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).

The library enables you to create Commands, Queries, Events, and their respective handlers in a decoupled fashion. The library also provides some starter code for Aggregate Root, for implementing Domain-Driven designs leveraging the CQRS pattern.

## Setup
Install the NuGet package: `Install-Package CQRS.Mediatr.Lite`.

## CQRS Basics
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It's a pattern that segregates the read and write pipeline. In complicated scenarios creating separate models and pipelines for reading and writing data helps in tackling the complexity. All operations in the system can be divided into 2 categories
 - Queries - Used only to read data from the database, and should not make any change to the state.
 - Commands - Change the state of the system by creating new data, updating existing data, or deleting data from the system.

Complex applications that can benefit from Domain-Driven-Design also draw advantage from CQRS.
